# FlowDoc Core 0.3.0 template entrypoint

## Authority Boundary

Owner: flowdoc-core. This file locates this package's implemented contract and runnable examples. Project Control owns the complete cross-repository authoring documentation and release acceptance; this guide does not publish templates or certify visual output.

Only `nodeModelVersion: 18` is accepted. Models 4–17 and their legacy content envelopes have been retired. Historical explanations remain in Git history and must not be used as current authoring instructions.

Read [Developer Documentation](../../flowdoc-project-control/docs/developer/authoring/README.md) for definitions, node properties, defaults, binding scopes, tables, contents, page numbering, image sizing and review rules. The [authoring workflow](../../flowdoc-project-control/docs/domains/flowdoc-ai-template-authoring-guide.md) covers draft creation through a complete reviewed PDF. Publish requires explicit user confirmation.

Code contracts: [template types](../src/template/types.ts), [prepared data](../src/data/types.ts), [resolved document](../src/composition/resolvedDocument.ts), and [public exports](../src/index.ts).

## Runnable examples

- `fixtures/area-document/`: explicit Section Area, owned format, nested business arrays and row groups.
- `fixtures/srs-basic/`: global variables and ordered Area text/table entries.
- `fixtures/areas/`: an authored table with Area content inside its cells.
- `fixtures/page-numbering/`: Section paper/bands, authored covers, excluded/hidden/restarted page numbering.
- `fixtures/table/`: short, empty and long tables with continuation.
- `fixtures/row-groups/`: repeated logical table groups.

Always validate a template and prepare its matching request before composition. The `sections` request object uses Section keys; the prepared snapshot uses Section IDs. Area formats use explicit ownerAreaId and key. They cannot declare another Area in their input schema. A reusable format with business arrays is distinct from an Area placement.

Run the Core build/tests and packed Linux consumer described in [README](../README.md). A successful validator or preview job ID alone does not prove the final PDF is complete: inspect its content, pagination, links and every rendered page.
